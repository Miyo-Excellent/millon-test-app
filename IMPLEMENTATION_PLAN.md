# Implementation Plan for Crypto Tracker App

This document outlines the plan for implementing the Crypto Tracker App based on the requirements and architecture defined in the project documentation.

## Current Status

The project has been set up with:
- React Native + Expo framework
- TypeScript configuration
- Project structure organization
- Comprehensive documentation
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- RTK Query for API integration
- React Native Paper UI components
- Navigation structure with Expo Router
- Core screens and functionality

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

✅ **Completed:**
- Project initialization with React Native and Expo
- TypeScript configuration
- Project structure organization
- Documentation (README, REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE, API, etc.)

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

✅ **Completed:**
- Create models for cryptocurrency data
- Implement Redux Toolkit for state management
- Set up RTK Query for API integration
- Implement caching and storage services
- Create utility functions for data formatting and calculations

#### Redux Store Structure Implemented:
- `store.ts`: Main Redux store configuration
- `cryptocurrencySlice.ts`: Slice for cryptocurrency data
- `marketSlice.ts`: Slice for market data
- `globalDataSlice.ts`: Slice for global market data
- `cryptoApi.ts`: RTK Query API for CoinLore integration
- `hooks.ts`: Typed hooks for accessing the store
- `provider.tsx`: Redux provider component

#### Models Implemented:
- `Cryptocurrency`: Class representing a cryptocurrency with private properties, public getters, and methods for business logic
- `Market`: Class representing a market with private properties, public getters, and methods for business logic
- `GlobalData`: Class representing global market data with private properties, public getters, and methods for business logic

All models follow OOP principles with proper encapsulation and include methods for serialization to plain objects for Redux compatibility.

#### Services Implemented:
- `StorageService.ts`: Service for local data persistence

### Phase 3: UI Components

✅ **Completed:**
- Set up React Native Paper UI component library
- Create custom theme configuration
- Integrate with React Navigation theming
- Configure provider structure
- Create base UI components using React Native Paper
- Implement cryptocurrency list components
- Create search and filter components
- Implement cryptocurrency detail view components
- Add loading and error states

#### Components Implemented:
- `CryptoList.tsx`: Component for displaying a list of cryptocurrencies with loading, error, and refresh states
- `CryptoCard.tsx`: Component for displaying cryptocurrency information in a compact format
- `SearchBar.tsx`: Component for searching cryptocurrencies with debounce functionality
- `FilterPanel.tsx`: Component for filtering cryptocurrencies by price range and sorting options
- `DetailView.tsx`: Component for displaying detailed cryptocurrency information including markets
- `LoadingIndicator.tsx`: Component for showing loading states with customizable text
- `ErrorDisplay.tsx`: Component for displaying error messages with retry functionality

#### Theme Implementation:
- `paperTheme.ts`: Custom theme configuration for React Native Paper
  - Custom colors for light and dark modes
  - Integration with React Navigation theme
  - Typography configuration
  - Elevation and roundness settings

### Phase 4: Screens and Navigation

✅ **Completed:**
- Set up tab navigation
- Implement home screen with cryptocurrency list
- Create detail screen for individual cryptocurrencies
- Add settings screen
- Implement search screen
- Configure navigation between screens
- Set up appropriate navigation options

#### Screens Implemented:
- `(tabs)/index.tsx`: Main screen with cryptocurrency list
- `detail.tsx`: Screen for displaying detailed cryptocurrency information
- `search.tsx`: Screen for searching and filtering cryptocurrencies
- `settings.tsx`: Screen for app settings and preferences

### Phase 5: Features and Functionality

✅ **Completed:**
- Implement cryptocurrency listing (without pagination)
- Add search functionality
- Implement filtering options
- Create detailed view (without price charts)
- Add refresh functionality
- Implement settings with theme switching (system theme and dark mode)
- Implement cache clearing functionality
- Configure Redux serialization to handle OOP model classes

**Partially implemented:**
- Currency preferences in settings (UI only, not persisted or used throughout the app)

**Future improvements:**
- Implement Redux integration for currency preferences
- Add pagination for cryptocurrency listing
- Add price charts in the detailed view
- Implement favorites functionality

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization

**In Progress:**
- Replace deprecated components with their recommended alternatives
  - ✅ Updated CryptoList.tsx to use Text component instead of deprecated Title and Paragraph
  - ✅ Ensured consistent typography styling across components
- Fix component integration issues
  - ✅ Created missing SearchBar and FilterPanel components
  - ✅ Updated component exports in index.ts file
  - ✅ Fixed import issues in search and detail screens
- ✅ Fix Redux Provider error
  - ✅ Created AppWrapper component to wrap the application with Redux Provider
  - ✅ Created ThemeProvider component to handle theme logic
  - ✅ Updated root layout component to ensure proper provider initialization
  - ✅ Fixed theme switching in settings screen
  - ✅ Restructured components to ensure Redux hooks are only called within Redux Provider
  - ✅ Created ThemeConsumer component to separate Redux-dependent code
- ✅ Fix Redux serialization issues
  - ✅ Resolved non-serializable value errors by ensuring class instances are converted to plain objects
  - ✅ Updated API transformResponse functions to use toPlainObject() method for all model instances
  - ✅ Configured Redux middleware to ignore RTK Query paths in state and actions
  - ✅ Improved Redux performance by preventing unnecessary serialization checks
- Write unit tests for components and services
- Perform performance optimization
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Test on different devices and screen sizes
- Optimize bundle size

### Phase 7: Finalization

**To be implemented:**
- Final UI polish
- Accessibility improvements
- Documentation updates
- Prepare for release

## Implementation Details

### Cryptocurrency List

The cryptocurrency list will:
- Display cryptocurrencies sorted by market cap
- Show name, symbol, price, and 24h change
- Support pagination (load more as user scrolls)
- Include pull-to-refresh functionality
- Support search and filtering

**Implementation approach:**
1. Use `FlatList` for efficient rendering of large lists
2. Implement pagination with the CoinLore API
3. Add search functionality with debounced input
4. Create filter options for sorting and filtering the list

### Cryptocurrency Detail View

The detail view will:
- Show comprehensive information about a cryptocurrency
- Display price changes (1h, 24h, 7d)
- Show market cap, volume, and supply information
- List markets where the cryptocurrency is traded

**Implementation approach:**
1. Fetch detailed data using the cryptocurrency ID
2. Create a visually appealing layout with sections
3. Implement error handling for missing data
4. Add loading states for data fetching

### Search and Filter

The search and filter functionality will:
- Allow searching by name or symbol
- Support filtering by price range, market cap, etc.
- Include sorting options (price, market cap, volume, etc.)
- Remember user preferences

**Implementation approach:**
1. Implement client-side filtering for already loaded data
2. Use API parameters for server-side filtering when possible
3. Store filter preferences in local storage
4. Create an intuitive UI for filter options

## Next Steps

1. Create the core models and services
2. Implement the API integration
3. Build the basic UI components
4. Set up the navigation structure
5. Implement the main features
6. Test and optimize the application
7. Finalize for release
